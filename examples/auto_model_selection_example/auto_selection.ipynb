It also has the capability to effectively manage high dimensionality, which can be beneficial given the 'low-signal data' characteristic of the dataset. While it does require high memory, it compensates with a short training time, making it suitable for your low memory requirement. Other models either struggle with small datasets or are less ideal for tabular data.\n",

Despite its weakness with discrete or categorical data, VAE handles tabular and noisy data well, is efficient in terms of memory and training time, making it a good fit for low-memory requirements.
