        "label": "sparse data",
        "explanation": "The GAN-based setup allows the model to learn boundaries even with sparse data, as it dynamically generates synthetic outliers to challenge the discriminator."

        "label": "real-time data",
        "explanation": "SO-GAAL is not optimized for real-time anomaly detection due to its iterative training process, which can introduce latency."

        "label": "noisy data",
        "explanation": "The model may struggle with noisy data, as noise can mislead the generator and discriminator, affecting the decision boundaries."

      {
        "label": "small dataset (<500)",
        "explanation": "SO-GAAL is susceptible to mode collapse, where the generator produces overly similar synthetic outliers, limiting the model's effectiveness in detecting diverse anomalies."

      {
        "label": "limited scalability",
        "explanation": "The model's reliance on a single generator-discriminator pair restricts its ability to scale effectively to larger datasets or handle datasets with extensive variability."

        "label": "minor distinctions",
        "explanation": "SO-GAAL may struggle to detect outliers when the distinctions between normal and abnormal data are subtle or involve complex relationships."
